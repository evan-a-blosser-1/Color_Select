# Color_Select

- This is a color palette selection tool, with screen color capture capabilities!

- All HTML color codes are displayed after they are chosen and can be saved in a text file for later use. 

*All images are open domain, stock photos, or of my best bud Loki* :)

# Running or Installation

## To Run:
- The program can run in any Interactive Development Environment (IDE) with the given img and info folder in the same working directory.

## To Install:
- The installation setup file is provided under the release, yet without valid publisher credentials. However, this method does not require any coding experience or Python to be installed. 

## Don't Trust IT!!:

The source code can be turned into your personal executable without using the provided setup file by using the pyinstaller .spec file, and the innu compiler file. 

1) Download all files, modify the .py scrpit as you wish, then save all files and folders into a single folder named whatever you want. (Having the folder on the desktop is easier!)
2) select this folder via the command line:
     - cd Desktop
     - cd Folder_Name
   
4) In the command line, within the selected folder, type:
     - pyinstaller Color_Picker.spec

5) Locate the dist folder that was just made in your "Folder_Name", this has the executable, but it can't run without the img and info folders next to it :(

6) Have no fear, load the innu compiler file and compile! This will create your own setup.exe to install your very own Color Select!
